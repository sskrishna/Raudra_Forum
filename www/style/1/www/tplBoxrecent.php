 * @todo make html that will result in rendering

 * be added by JS dynamically.
 * JS will dynamically add ONLY tabs and will
 * subscribe them to onClick to dymanically
 * download the content of the tab body.
 *
 * Then this template will not be good for
 * 'unanswered' tabs, then we will have to
 * make separate template for holding unanswered tabs
 * and we can just copy this one or something like that
