/**
 * Set names of blocks and location
 * file that you going to import
 *
 * Get these files from MaxMind website:
 * http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
 *
 * Choose to download GeoLite City in csv format
 * then unzip the downloaded zip file
 * and copy the 2 .csv files in this directory
 * (2 files will approximately 150MB total)
 *
 * Make sure to upload them in ASCII mode
 * (your ftp client/server must be set to transfer the .csv files
 * in ASCII mode)
 *
 * If you want, you may also buy the non-free versions from MixMind,
 * in which case
 * you would change the names of the 2 files below
 * to the names of files that came with your full version of
 * GeoCity .cvs files.
 *
 * Then just run this geo_import.php file via web browser.
 * It may take 5-10 minutes to complete the import,
 * the importer script imports over 4 million records one by one
 * then creating 2 indexes in the database
 *
 * After the importing is done you should delete these .csv files
 * If you don't delete them then anyone can lauhch this file with a browser
 * and it will start the import all over again.
 *
 * If you want to later upgrade to latest files from MaxMind site
 * just upload the new .csv files and run this script again - it will
 * drop the previously imported DB collections and import new files.
